            My favorite restaurant is FOOD LLC, in this place serves Italian food.&nbsp;It is a small and comfortable place located in Heredia downtown.

Almost always, I eat supreme pizza with a cold Ice tea. Is so&nbsp;excitedenergetic&nbsp;to continuous my day. Also, It is my favorite place to eat because in others place I don’t like the way that the waitress take the orders, when served the food long time after or they are&nbsp;miserable, for me is so&nbsp;stressed out&nbsp;and&nbsp;irritable&nbsp;to go it again. to have this option maybe because is the best of Heredia, for me. When I finish the meal, I go out so.&nbsp;The main idea is the paragraph’s central thrust. In academic writing, that thrust is often argumentative—a
paragraph makes an assertion that’s part of the writer’s larger claim. Often the main idea appears in the
paragraph’s first sentence, where it is sometimes called the “topic sentence.” However, some paragraphs
offer their main idea in the second, third, or last sentence; some don’t have a single sentence that
encapsulates the main idea. That said, your reader should come away from each paragraph with a clear
understanding of its main idea. He or she shouldn’t have to stop and reread the paragraph, trying to figure
out what it’s saying.
It’s true that a paragraph should usually focus on a single idea—paragraphs are, after all, the bite-sized
chunks into which you break your argument so that your reader will be able to digest it easily. But keep in
mind that, to some degree, you can bring unity to a paragraph that seems to contain two or three ideas by
showing how those ideas really fit under the same umbrella. The way a paragraph conveys its claim, in
other words, dictates whether your reader will see it as a coherent idea or as a hodge-podge of different
points.
